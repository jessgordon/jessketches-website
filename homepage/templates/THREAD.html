          <h1>THREAD</h1>
          <h2>Embroidered photographs</h2><br>
          <p>I really enjoy the process of being able to collaborate with others through photograph embroidery, as some photographs
          used where not captured by myself. This increased the depth and sentimental meaning to the work.</p>
          <p>For example, I was able to collaborate with my late grandfather whilst working on photographs he had taken, as I joined
          together my embroidery and the imagery that he had seen, experienced and chosen to capture. I treasure this technique for
          its ability to connect me with others that I love.</p>

          along with other photos and/or writing. The doves have been embroidered around their outlines with light lilac thread, with some of
          the tails of the doves having thread left hanging out. One person’s woolly hat has also been embroidered with a deep pink thread.">
